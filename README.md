# python-pipe

## What is the goal of python-pipe
We seek to construct a foundation on which data driven projects might be built upon. 
Though the construction of ABClasses under the umbrellas of CONNECT, READ and 
OPERATE, we are enabled to construct predictable input-output pairs. The pipe 
(DAG) is constructed from user generated classes inheriting from the above 
mentioned ABCs. This enables analytics personal time and head space to work 
on their projects. The first project to make use of this foundation will be 
a schema change detector.
